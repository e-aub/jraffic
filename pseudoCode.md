Looking at your code, I can see you have a traffic simulation with lanes and traffic lights. To implement a traffic light algorithm that controls vehicle movement (removing just the moving of cars), here's the pseudocode for the `update()` method in the `TrafficLights` class:This pseudocode provides two algorithms:

1. **Basic Cycling Algorithm**: Simple time-based cycling between North-South and East-West traffic with fixed green, yellow, and red durations.

2. **Advanced Traffic-Responsive Algorithm**: A more sophisticated system that:
   - Detects vehicle presence near intersections
   - Extends green lights when there's traffic demand
   - Switches phases when opposing traffic is waiting and current traffic is clear
   - Maintains minimum and maximum green times for fairness

The algorithm removes the direct vehicle movement logic and focuses purely on traffic light state management. The vehicle movement logic remains in your individual lane classes (`NorthLane`, `SouthLane`, etc.) where they check the traffic light states to determine if vehicles should move or stop.

To implement this, you'll need to add the timing variables and state enum to your `TrafficLights` class, then replace or add the `update()` method with one of these algorithms.
